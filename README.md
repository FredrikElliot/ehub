# eHUB
This is a report only repository for eHUB. This means no code is hosted here and the main purpose is to enable users of eHUB to report issues they find in the software as well submit ideas for improvement. This should both be done as an issue, from the ["Issues"](https://github.com/studio27ab/ehub/issues/) tab.

Issues are like tickets, and do not only cover problems/bugs as the naming implies. Also improvements and refactors are covered as issues, and will be found in the issue list.

You can always as questions in the dicussion forum, or through the contact form on our ["webpage"](https://studio27.se/contact/).
