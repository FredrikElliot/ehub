# Reporting Security Issues

Studio 27 AB and the eHUB team take security bugs in the system seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/studio27ab/ehub/security/advisories/new) tab.

The eHUB team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [contact form on Studio 27's webpage](https://www.studio27.se/contact).

## The Studio 27 Security Notification Process

Studio 27 and the eHUB team will disclose security issues when reported to clients that are directly impacted. Once the security vulnerability is solved, it will be disclosed as part of release documentation.
